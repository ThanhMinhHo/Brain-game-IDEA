            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>The app that I am going to make call "ZBrain", it is a game that
                design to help the users to exercise their brain that contributing to study better at school,
                focus at work and importantly maintaining psychological well-being.
            </p>
            <p> There will be different level of the game, the user allows to play to the next level when they are
                completed the certain level.
                It will be select the combination of two topics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Logic</li>
                <li>Memory match</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Firstly, the logic of the game that is designed to be natural and simple way that can suitable for most
                people. That involving:
                <ul>
                    <li>Finding the unique item in the collection of similar things</li>
                    <li>Selecting to ascending/descending number</li>
                    <li>Multiple choice question allows the users to select the correct answer base on the knowledge
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, memory match is concentration game that contains matching images with different topics with
                well design. The board size varies depend on the difficulty per level (2x2 tiles, 3x3 tiles, 4x4 tiles,
                etc.). All
                of the cards (images) are laid face down on a surface. In
                order to play the game, the user need to tap to open up to two cards at any time, and when they are a
                match then
                they stay revealed. When they are not match
                they will face up again. Therefore, player is required to
                remember cards positions to try and match all cards in the fewest steps possible.
                There will be the time limit and the number step allow to complete the game.
            </p>
            <p>When the users finish each level, the app will be rating their performances.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Background">
            <h2>2. Background</h2>
            <p>Problem solving skills is essential and critical skills at any position and every industry that required
                creativity and logical thinking. Scientists from Yale University state that warming up the brain
                improves children learning ability that help our brain prepare for the upcoming tasks and enhances
                performances (Wexler, B. E. et al. 2016). There are several ways to improve people execute function,
                computer training is one of the way to gains the cognitive skills that improve reasoning, working memory
                (Alloway 2013).
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, brain fog is getting common nowadays
                that has effected many people. It has a cognitive dysfunction that involving memory problems, poor
                concentration
                and inability to focus. Therefore, it is important to create a great brain-training game
                that
                exercise our brain to make it productive and improve people concentration and focusing ability.
            </p>
            <p>There are many mobile app that available in the market. However, there are a
                huge potential to improve in the functionality, content and user interface of the App.
                ZBrain app has a new approach both in design and functionality that can take advantages compare to
                others
                app.
                It encourages people to play in their leisure time.
                ZBrain has a goal is to enjoy user in every minute of the game and more importantly that help boost user
                cognition
                ability.

                        exercise the brain well. However,
                        it seems to take time to play and required peer to play with. The peer might need to have the
                        same level of skills to play. Moreover,
                        there are no doubt about the traditional chess game that has fun and challenge when play. But I
                        think with the increase of information technology, brain-training might suitable in some point
                        and take some advantages
                        over chess game where user can solve the challenge and improve brain thinking.

                        and remembering. Overall, I love this game. One thing I think it should be change, that is when
                        the users change the modes of the game which it is not a great position in design.

                        I would rate 4.8 out of 5 for that game. The overall design is seemed to be very good
                        characteristic. However, I think the user interface at some point should be improve. The user
                        navigation also need to update to make it easy to navigate to the entire the app. </p>

            <h2>4. Features</h2>
            <p>After taking the survey of the brain training in the app market. It is a great opportunity for me to
                reflect what have been done so far, what functionality that offer. More importantly, what users
                like/unlike the most to form my own features. I also add some features that I think it would provide
                better user experiences. Below is the list of the features that ZBrain have.
            </p>
            <ol id="featureOl">
                <li>Having board range of Logic, memory match and multiple-choice question on variety of context.
                    Most of the competitors do not provide a range of context challenge. Playing with ZBrain, the users
                    will have the great experiences on different challenges and the rich context of interaction. </li>
                <li>For the type of memory match, firstly, the user will have the opportunity to view the entire
                    board before they play the game in given time that depend on the difficulty of the game. It allows
                    the user to reduce the number of step for solving the problem as well as improve the ability to
                    concentration and remember card pair.
                </li>
                <li>For the logic type game, the user first gives the chance to look at the question and decide the best
                    solution. It helps users to have a deep thinking on the problem. ZBrain also give the hint for the
                    users when they have difficulty. The hint will be give when they select wrong answer. </li>
                <li>ZBrain has the content and challenge is researched carefully and organise according to level of
                    difficulty </li>
                <li>ZBrain give advice when the user could not able to answer the questions, so users is relaxing and
                    enjoy the app </li>

                <li>The next game and challenge will be unlocking when the users pass the current level with 3-star
                    rating. It helps users to focus on each game and it is the value of the game. </li>
                <li>The game is replayed current level when user fails to pass this level without go back to the initial
                    level. It will give the users great experiences. </li>
                <li>
                    ZBrain is designed to allow the user to go from the easy level to challenges level so that it builds
                    the strengthen mind.
                </li>
                <li>Celebrating users when they completed each game. It also rates the user performances
                    depend on how fast they solve as well as the number of step (lower number of tries are better
                    scores). It is the great way to give the award
                    for
                    their achievement.
                </li>
                <li>ZBrain allows users to share the result with friends on Facebook</li>
                <li>ZBrain provide the great way to navigate the entire application without any difficulty.</li>
                <li>ZBrain have portrait and landscape screen. It also cross platform apps so that give the users
                    experience on mobile and tablet devices.</li>

                <li>Play without internet, it is not a problem with ZBrain</li>

                    element, and swaps it with others
                    element. It keeps doing until it has swapped every element.
